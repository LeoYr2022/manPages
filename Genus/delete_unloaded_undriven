Name
       delete_unloaded_undriven

Syntax
       delete_unloaded_undriven

       [-disconnect] [-force_bit_blast] [-all] [-inout] [<design>] [> <file>]

Description
       Disconnects  subports and hierarchical pins connected to constants and that do not fanout to anything, and deletes
       unloaded and undriven subports from the design. Use this command as a post-processing step to  remove  any  unused
       subports from the netlist.

       By default the command skips individual bits of a bus that are connected to constants or that are unused.

Parameters
       -all   Additionally, deletes unloaded and undriven top-level ports from the design.

       <design>
              Specifies the design from which to remove the unused ports or subports.

       -disconnect
              Only  disconnects the subports and hierarchical pins that are connected to constants and that do not fanout
              to anything.

       <file> Specifies the name of the file to which the output of the command should be redirected.

       -force_bit_blast
              Bitblasts modules that have individual bus bits that are unused or connected to constants and  deletes  the
              unused bus bits.

       -inout Specifies to delete disconnected inout pins too.

Examples
        *  The following command deletes the top-level ports that are either unconnected or are connected to constants in
       the design.
