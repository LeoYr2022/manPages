Name
       remove_assigns


Object Name
       Root attributes


Syntax
       remove_assigns {false | true}


Description
       Default: false

       Read-write  root attribute. Determines whether assign
       statements  should  be  replaced  with   buffers   or
       inverters in the netlist.

       When  this  attribute  is  set to true, the generated
       netlist  will  not  contain  any  assign  statements.
       Depending   on  the  availability  of  cells  in  the
       library,     and     the     settings     of      the
       set_remove_assign_options    command,    the   assign
       statements  might  be  replaced   with   buffers   or
       inverters.

Examples
       For  the  following  examples,  assume  the following
       constant assignments in the RTL code:

       assign out1 = 1'b0;
       assign out2 = 1'b0;

        * If the remove_assigns attribute us set  to  false,
       the netlist will remain unchanged.

        *  If  the  remove_assigns attribute us set to true,
       the netlist will look like:

       BUFX1 rm_assigns_buf_q3(.A (1'b0), .Y (out1));
       BUFX1 rm_assigns_buf_q3(.A (1'b0), .Y (out2));
